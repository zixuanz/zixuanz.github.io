I hope this is my last "First Blog".

Well, until right now, I temporally completed design of index page.

I had a serious problem which is cannot include a css to html page correctly. I think that was caused by site.url settings. I could not get through it. Thus I decided just write into each pages. At least it was convenient for me to modify the style.

Next, I will start styling post.html and write more and more blogs used for testing!
