I hope this is my last "First Blog".

Well, until right now, I temporally completed design of index page.

I had a serious problem which is cannot include a css to html page correctly. I think that was caused by site.url settings. I could not get through it. Thus I decided just write into each pages. At least it was convenient for me to modify the style.

What else I can do in index.html page:
+ The toggle button, which is for the collapsed navbar menu, will be modified to the similar style of webpage.
+ The collapsed menu is not good looking. I will try to have before-collapse and after-collapse design.
+ Navbar will be stick to top when scroll over it.
+ Create foot.html and include it in.
+ After all sections in index page are done, modify details such as how to show time.

Next, I will start styling post.html and write more and more blogs used for testing!
